   - No runtime type resolution issues
   - Smaller binary size and improved startup performance

2. Enhanced Security
   - Eliminated reflection-based serialization vulnerabilities
   - Removed potential type inference attack vectors
   - Safer JSON handling with explicit type constraints
   - Reduced attack surface for serialization exploits
   - Better protection against deserialization attacks

3. Performance Optimizations
   - Faster JSON construction without reflection overhead
   - Reduced memory allocations
   - Improved cache locality
   - Better startup time for trimmed applications
   - Lower memory footprint

4. .NET 10 Compatibility
   - Full support for .NET 10 preview builds
   - Manual JSON construction throughout
   - No breaking changes to existing functionality

5. Testing Improvements
   - Additional tests for AOT/trimming scenarios
   - Security-focused unit tests
   - Performance benchmarking tests
   - 100% pass rate with all new tests

Breaking Changes: None - fully backward compatible

Release 2.3.0 — 2025-12-13
===============================================================================

Complete Content Type Support - Forms, Files, Deep Paths

1. Form Body Support (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
   - Automatic conversion of form data to JSON
   - Single + multiple values (arrays for duplicate field names)
   - Special character escaping (quotes, backslashes, newlines, tabs)
   - Unicode and emoji support
   - Manual JSON construction for .NET 10 compatibility

2. File Upload Support (multipart/form-data)
   - Memory-safe streaming: Files read through 8KB buffer and dumped
   - Metadata extraction: filename, content type, size, bytes read
   - Multiple files + mixed form fields in single request
   - Large file support (tested with 100MB+)
   - Constant O(1) memory usage regardless of file size

3. Arbitrary Path Lengths
   - Full support for deep nested paths (tested to 21 segments)
   - Query parameters fully preserved
   - Works with all HTTP methods + content types
   - Perfect for RESTful API structures

Usage Examples:
  # Form submission
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5116/api/mock/users/register \
    -d "username=john&email=john@example.com"

  # File upload
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5116/api/mock/photos/upload \
    -F "title=My Photo" -F "image=@photo.jpg"

  # Deep path
  curl "http://localhost:5116/api/mock/v1/api/products/electronics/laptops"

Testing: 60 new tests (405 total, 100% pass rate)
  - FormBodyHandlingTests.cs (12 tests) - form parsing
  - JsonHandlingTests.cs (25 tests) - escaping + extraction
  - V2_3_0_FeatureTests.cs (23 tests) - full integration

Technical: Manual JSON construction throughout for .NET 10 AOT compatibility

Docs: TEST_SUMMARY.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, V2_3_0_TESTS.md

Breaking Changes: None - fully backward compatible
